# velocity-analysis
This is a Python 3 code that sets up a GUI for simple analysis of seismic first-break data using user-controlled regression analysis.

This is a code I am currently developing for my employment as a reasearch assistant at Western University. The code is self-contained although will only open specially formatted distance/time data from refraction first break analysis. The aim is to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for quickly determining layer velocities, both manually and automatically using regression analysis.
